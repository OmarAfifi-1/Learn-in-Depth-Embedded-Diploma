## Work Sections
This repository contains the codes required for each lecture or exam throughout the diploma. The reports, runs, simulations, videos and designs are uploaded on a google drive [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1yAjTu2aPpjMnhxqZaWZqF3gurNyyik82), while my quiz scores can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v8WbbSE8ONzNLCfilKyJVyXNOmRcwO3j/edit#gid=2075900150) and the exam scores [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F39uDphKOST4-x407xi4O9DBWbGZQ5ti/edit#gid=1345816106).
